# Overview

The `devops-pack` is used to hack around with `nix flakes` and various well know devops toolings, e.g. `kubernetes`.

It currently relies on [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) which wraps evalModules.

As it's easier to spin up some of the tools as plaine docker services, this is far from being pure atm and should be considered as a simple source for ideas.
